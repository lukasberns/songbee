            <verse>
            <line>My <sup text="C">hope</sup> is built on nothing less</line>
            <line>Than Jesus' blood and righteousness,</line>
            <line>No merit of my own I claim, </line>
            <line>but wholly trust in Jesus' name,</line>
            </verse>
            <chorus>
                <line>On Christ the solid rock I stand,</line>
                <line>All other ground is sinking sand.</line>
            </chorus>
            <verse>
            <line>When weary in this earthly race,</line>
            <line>I rest on his unchanging grace,</line>
            <line>Through every wild and stormy gale, </line>
            <line>My anchor holds and will not fail</line>
            </verse>
            <verse>
            <line>His vow, his covenant and blood</line>
            <line>Are my defence against the flood,</line>
            <line>When earthly hopes are swept away,</line>
            <line>He will uphold me on that day</line>
            </verse>
            <verse>
                <line>When the last trumpet's call shall sound,</line>
                <line>Oh may I then in Him be found, </line>
                <line>Clothed in His righteousness alone, </line>
                <line>Faultless to stand before His throne. </line>
