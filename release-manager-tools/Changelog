What's new in Songbee 2.0

* Songbee not only supports songs, but is now extensible to allow display 
  of other kinds of material: Bible passages, web sites, and so on.

* Two such extensions are currently part of Songbee:
  : If you are online, Bible passages will be displayed from the online
    ESV. This is a proof-of-concept until we have sorted out Bible
    licensing.
  : You can add a web site address into a playlist and have the site appear
    on the projector.

* You can add any additional "annotations" to a song that you like - for
  instance, the hymnal name and hymn number. Future versions will allow
  you to search on this data.

* When one song is marked as a translation of another, the option is
  given during worship to switch between translations of the current song.

* You can change the style (background, colours, etc.) of individual playlists.

* The menus have been rearranged to make creating new types of material easier.

* On the "edit playlist" window, you can now drag songs from the library
  into your playlist.

* Fix problem where databases were getting locked and could no longer be
  modified.

* Fix problem where the "edit playlist" window was coming up empty.

* The default display now has its text nearer the top edge of the projector;
  verse text is also centered on the screen.
